##Repository Description

This repository contains the files to simulate a basic **Unix Shell** with its respective commands. It uses the POSIX API to implement many of the same functionalities of the first Ken Thompson's Shell and It is made to carry out the  **C - Simple Shell** project at [ALX Africa.](https://www.alxafrica.com/ "ALX Africa.")

The predominantly used calls are **read**, **write**, **open**, **execve**, **exit**, **fflush**, **fork**, **free**, **malloc**, **getline**, **isatty**, **perror**, **strtok**, **wait**, and **waitpid**.

This simple shell is a Shell interface written in C programming language that gives to the user a prompt *Hell_Shell>> *, after it accepts, it executes a user inputted command in a separate process called child process.
